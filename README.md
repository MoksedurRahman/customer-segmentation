# customer-segmentation
Problem Type: Unsupervised Learning → Clustering : Segment mall customers into distinct groups based on spending behavior. 

## 🧠 Problem Type
**Unsupervised Learning – Clustering**

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: [Mall Customers Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)
- **Features**: Age, Annual Income, Spending Score

## 📌 Objective
Segment customers into distinct clusters based on income and spending behavior using K-Means.

## 📈 Workflow
1. Load and preprocess dataset
2. Standardize features
3. Determine optimal k using the elbow method
4. Apply K-Means clustering
5. Visualize clusters
6. Evaluate with Silhouette Score

## 💡 Results
- Best k: 5 clusters
- Silhouette Score: ~0.55
- Visualized clusters saved in `outputs/`

## 📦 Tools & Libraries
`Python`, `Pandas`, `Scikit-learn`, `Seaborn`, `Matplotlib`
